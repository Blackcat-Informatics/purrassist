# purrassist-toolgraph

Pure Rust validation for caller-owned tool-graph vocabulary, loss-profile and
context field-mask inputs. No vocabulary namespace is supplied implicitly.

This workspace crate is unpublished while its required upstream APIs use an
exact Git revision. Facade/host integration and registry-resolvable packaging
remain part of the complete graph-loader delivery. The existing release set
retains its registry-resolvable dependencies.

Run the executable caller example with
`cargo run -p purrassist-toolgraph --example validate_vocabulary`.

Implemented: validated vocabulary construction, registered projection loss
meanings and the bounded four-form field-mask parser. Graph loading, schema
projection, manifest codecs, authorization and execution remain specified in
the repository's tool-graph documents; this crate does not yet provide them.
